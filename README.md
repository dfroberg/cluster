## :book:&nbsp; Overview

This is home to my personal Lab cluster. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches this Git repository and makes the changes to my cluster based on the manifests in the [cluster](./cluster/) directory. [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) also watches this Git repository and creates pull requests when it finds updates to Docker images, Helm charts, and other dependencies.

For more information, head on over to my [docs](https://dfroberg.github.io/cluster/).

## :handshake:&nbsp; Community

Thanks to all the people who donate their time to the [Kubernetes @Home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/) community.
